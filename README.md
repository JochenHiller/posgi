# Implementation of OSGi in C++

## Overview

This project is a first, simple C++ based implementation of OSGi. It is intended to refresh my old C++ skills with latest C++ versions.

It will be limited to core features of OSGi R8, which are applicable to be implemented in C++ as well.

## Roadmap

## Minimum viable product (MVP)

* Install bundles from existing binary
* Start and and stop bundles
* Console bundle to manage framework and bundles (input: stdin/stdout console)
* Bundle tracker

## Further features

* Service registry
* SCR, OSGI-INF/*.xml
* GCC, LLVM compiler support

### Out-of-Scope

* dynamic loading of bundles (as shared libraries)
  * packaging of bundles (as ZIP)
