## Overview

This project is a first, simple C++ based implementation of OSGi. It is intended to refresh my old C++ skills with latest C++ versions. For more details see my [history](docs/history.md).

It will be limited to core features of OSGi R8, which are applicable to be implemented in C++ as well.
